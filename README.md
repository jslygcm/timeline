my personal blog's theme (powered by WordPress)

I want to create a special theme for my own blog which is powered by WordPress. The blog is used to record my life, study and other meaningful things happened in my life. So I call the theme timeline, for events and time. 
It's easy to use WordPress to build your own blog since it separates your blog's content from it's form. So I can even write posts about how I build this blog. I do think it's an intresting thing.
So, let's begin. Wish me good luck, ;).
